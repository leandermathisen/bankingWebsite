# bankingWebsite

This is a website framework for a banking system. It uses node and express for backend, html/css for the frontend, and a mysql database. The purpose is to be able to log in and check your accounts and transfer funds to other members. There will also be calculators for financial purposes like mortgages and auto loans.

### Currently does.
- You can log into an existing account and check the balances of your accounts. 
- There is a transfer page which does nothing at the moment.
- You can create a new account with the sign up page.
- You can also create a new account, where you can specify the account type and initial deposit amount.
- You can logout and switch accounts as well.

### Need to add.
- Finish transfer page to transfer funds between users or accounts.
- Decide which calculator pages to create.
- Make account balances into a proper table.
- Finish css.

### Ideas for future.
- Encryption for password protection.
- Implement an angular frontend.
- Allow for accounts and memberships to be closed.
