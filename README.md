# bankingWebsite

This is a website framework for a banking system. It uses node and express for backend and html/css for the frontend. The purpose is to be able to log in and check your accounts and transfer funds to other members. There will also be calculators for financial purposes like mortgages and auto loans. \

### Currently does.
Currently you can log into an existing account and check your balance and there is a transfer page which does nothing at the moment. \

### Need to add.
- Encryption for password protection. \
- Outline the exact schemas for the database tables to contain the information. \
- Finish the sign up page to insert users into the database. \
- Allow for multiple accounts per user, which can be different types. (ie. savings or checkings) \
- Finish transfer page to transfer funds between users or accounts. \

### Ideas for future.
- Implement an angular frontend. \
- Allow for accounts to be closed. \s
